Encapsulation means hiding or binding the data into single capsule 
and capsule means class or wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit called Encapsulation.

Steps to Perform Encapsulation
1)Declare the variable of the class as private -> means data hiding.
2)prvide public getter & setters methods for modify and view the variable values.

Why Encapsulation?

1)Better control of class attributes and methods
2)Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
3)Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
Increased security of data
