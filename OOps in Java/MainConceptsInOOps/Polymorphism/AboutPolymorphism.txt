Polymorphism in Java

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define Java Polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. In this article, we will learn what is polymorphism and it’s type.

Real-life Illustration of Polymorphism in Java: A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behaviors in different situations. This is called polymorphism. 

What is Polymorphism in Java?

Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

Types of Java Polymorphism

In Java Polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: 

1. Compile-time Polymorphism
2. Runtime Polymorphism

Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java: 

It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. 

Note: But Java doesn’t support the Operator Overloading.

Java Polymorphism

Compile Time Polymorphism or Method Overloading : 

When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.

Example 1:


// Java Program for Method overloading
// By using Different Types of Arguments 

// Class 1
// Helper class
class Helper {

    // Method with 2 integer parameters
    static int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        // Returns product of integer numbers
        return a * b;
    }

    // Method 2
    // With same name but with 2 double parameters
    static double Multiply(double a, double b)
    {
        // Returns product of double numbers
        return a * b;
    }
}

// Class 2
// Main class
class GFG {
    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Calling method by passing
        // input as in arguments
        System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(2, 4));
        System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(5.5, 6.3));
    }
}


Output

Runtime Polymorphism in Java:

It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.

Example


// Java Program for Method Overriding

// Class 1
// Helper class
class Parent {

    // Method of parent class
    void Print()
    {

        // Print statement
        System.out.println("parent class");
    }
}

// Class 2
// Helper class
class subclass1 extends Parent {

    // Method
    void Print() { System.out.println("subclass1"); }
}

// Class 3
// Helper class
class subclass2 extends Parent {

    // Method
    void Print()
    {

        // Print statement
        System.out.println("subclass2");
    }
}

// Class 4
// Main class
class GFG {

    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

        // Creating object of class 1
        Parent a;

        // Now we will be calling print methods
        // inside main() method

        a = new subclass1();
        a.Print();

        a = new subclass2();
        a.Print();
    }
}

Output
subclass1
subclass2
