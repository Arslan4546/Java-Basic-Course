Variables are of three types:
1. Local Variables
A Variable which is declared inside the body of the method and also  inside the parameter of the method  


class a {
    
    int method(){
        int a = 19;
        int b =12;
        int c = a+b;
        return c; 
    }
}

and 


class a {
    
    int method(int a , int b){
      
        int c = a+b;
        return c; 
    }
}

2. Instance Variale
A variable which is declared inside the class but outside of all the methods in the class is called instance Variables

class a {
      int a = 19;
        int b =12;

    int method(){
        int c = this(a+b);
        return c; 
    }
}





3. Static Variale
A variable which is declared with  the Static keyword is called Static variable.

class a {
      static int a = 19;
       static  int b =12;

    int method(){
        int c = this(a+b);
        return c; 
    }
}
